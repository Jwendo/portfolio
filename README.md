# **My name is Joyce Wendo**

I am a Web developer, educator, and Remote Work Advocate. I founded Pens by Wendo and currently building iTechMaster from ground up.

I have taught IT for almost 10 years and since I moved from my home country to live and work in Germany, i run these classes through Social media.[Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/its_me_wendo/) and [Facebook!](https://www.facebook.com/pensbywendo/). 

I hold a Bsc. in Information technology from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and a Data Science Nano Degree from Silicon Valley's Udacity.

In my free time you will regularly find me playing with my band [Harambee Live!](https://www.facebook.com/harambeelive/) around the city of Osnabrück!
